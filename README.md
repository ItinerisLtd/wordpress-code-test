# WordPress Code Test

## Project brief

**TODO(Lee): Add a "real" task here**

You don't have to implement everything perfectly. Tell us about the expected use cases, potential pitfalls or any suggestions.

## Requirements

**TODO(Lee): Add more into this section**

1. Use [Trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis)
1. Use [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock)
1. Use [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) (if you are applying for a frontend / full-stack position)
1. Use object oriented design patterns
1. Follow [Itineris WP Coding Standards](https://github.com/ItinerisLtd/itineris-wp-coding-standards)
1. Follow the [TangRufus' way of structuring Trellis & Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/trellis/issues/883#issuecomment-329052189)

## Allowed & Not Allowed

## Submission

We will give you 2 GitHub repos to fork. Make **one single** pull request to each of the repos as submission. Pretend you are one of us and implementing it for a client, i.e: write good commits titles and descriptions (as well as pull requests).

## Project Deadline

**TODO(Lee): Change this section**

Take your time but try to deliver it within 2 weeks time. If we don't see any activity in your test repository after 2 weeks (at least initial commits), we will automatically withdraw your application.

## Tips

- Use latest stable whenever possible, e.g: PHP, WordPress core, plugins, packages
- Best practice everywhere
- Think about security
- Make the site the smallest possible size - optimize images, disable jQuery or any other unnecessary scripts/stylesheets, etc
- Make the site loads as faster as possible
- Set up a virtual host with your project repository name (eg. `yourname-wp-code-test.test`) so we don't have search & replace URLs when testing your project
- Don't develop on Windows machines
- Reusability - Bonus points to those who could abstract common code into separate packages
- Be proactive - We take "expected use cases, potential pitfalls or any suggestions" very seriously
- Be prepared - We will discuss your code in the next interview
